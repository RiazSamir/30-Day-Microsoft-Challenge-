# Day 03 – Sentinel Setup 

## Objective:
- Deploy Microsoft Sentinel and understand its core operational components

## Platform / Tools:
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Azure Log Analytics Workspace
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)

## Actions Performed 
- Configured Log Analytics Workspace (LAW) for central storage of Logs (*Figure 1*)
- Connected Setinel to LAW for log centralization (*Figure 2*)
- Installed Sentinel and gained familiarity of the things available such as Logs, analytics, Workbooks, Incidents, etc (*Figure 3*)


## SOC Importance
- Sentinel is designed for modern security operations centres that need to scale, move faster, and make decisions based on real insights. It provides:
  - A unified view across your users, devices, applications, and infrastructure.
  - Built in analytics and threat intelligence to surface real threats.
  - Automation tools to reduce manual work and speed up incident response. It does this using Playbooks.
  - Full visibility across both Microsoft and non-Microsoft environments.
