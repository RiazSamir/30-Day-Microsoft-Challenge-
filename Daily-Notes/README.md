# Daily SOC Challenge Notes

This directory contains day-by-day investigation notes completed as part of the
30-Day Microsoft Security Challenge.

Each file represents a single day of hands-on SOC activity using the Microsoft
Security stack. The purpose of these notes is to document investigative thinking,
log analysis, and outcomes rather than provide long-form theory.
