# Daily SOC Challenge Notes

This directory contains day-by-day investigation notes completed as part of the
30-Day Microsoft Security Challenge.

The daily entries reflect a progressive SOC build-out, starting with platform
familiarisation and data onboarding, followed by detection development, investigation,
and reporting.


## What the Daily Notes Cover

Daily activities may include:

- Microsoft Sentinel setup and configuration
- Connecting and validating security data sources
- Integrating Microsoft Defender XDR telemetry
- Creating dashboards, bookmarks, and reports
- Investigating authentication, endpoint, and email-based threats
- Developing detection and triage workflows

While some days focus on platform configuration, all activities directly support
SOC visibility, detection, and investigation capabilities.

## How to Read the Daily Notes

Each daily entry captures:

- **Objective** – What SOC capability was enabled or explored
- **Tools / Platform** – Microsoft services used that day
- **Actions Performed** – Key configuration or investigative steps
- **SOC Relevance** – Why the activity matters in a real SOC
- **Outcome** – Result or capability achieved
